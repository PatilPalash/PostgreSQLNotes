  * `ST_Buffer`: Create buffer zones
  * `ST_Distance`: Measure distance between geometries
* Try spatial joins: find schools within 5km of hospitals, roads crossing rivers, etc.
* Start thinking about SQL views for dashboards

### 📅 **Week 4: Python + SQL using psycopg2**

* Install `psycopg2`:

  ```bash
  pip install psycopg2
  ```
* Connect Python to PostgreSQL:

  ```python
  import psycopg2
  conn = psycopg2.connect(database="yourdb", user="user", password="pass")
  ```
* Run queries and insert GIS data from Python
* Automate data load from CSV/Excel to PostGIS

---

### 📅 **Week 5: Python + GIS using GeoPandas**

* Install:

  ```bash
  pip install geopandas
  ```
* Use `GeoPandas` to:

  * Read shapefiles: `gdf = geopandas.read_file('file.shp')`
  * Save to PostGIS: `gdf.to_postgis('table_name', conn)`
  * Query from PostGIS and plot maps
* Visualize data using `matplotlib`, `folium`, or `geopandas.plot()`

---

### 📅 **Week 6: Mini Project**

Build a **small end-to-end GIS project**:

1. Choose dataset: rivers, roads, disaster zones, population
2. Load into PostGIS and clean
3. Perform spatial analysis:

   * Example: “Which villages are within 2km of a river and flood zone?”
4. Visualize using Python maps (GeoPandas or Folium)
5. Document your results in a Jupyter Notebook

---

### 💡 Extra Tips

* Use [Natural Earth](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/) or [OpenStreetMap](https://download.geofabrik.de/) for free GIS data.
* Read docs on `ST_Intersects`, `ST_Union`, `ST_Envelope` for more complex tasks.
* Practice spatial query logic — interviewers often ask “how would you find X within Y km of Z?”
