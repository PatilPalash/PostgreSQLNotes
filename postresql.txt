1) add this path in env C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\16\bin
user variable.
2) open cmd and type 
psql -U postgres- its ask 
Password for user postgres:Abcd@123

List down existing databases
SELECT datname FROM pg_database;
\l

Some Important Queries in starting
\l - list all databases
\q - quit
\c db_name - connect to database
\dt - list all tables
\d tb_name - describe a table (if table name in update or camel 	     case write in " ")
\d+ tb_name - list all column
\! cls.- list all column

INSERTING Data
Adding data into a Table

single 
INSERT INTO person(id, name, city)
VALUES (101,‚ÄòRaju‚Äô,‚ÄòDelhi‚Äô);

multiple
INSERT INTO person(id, name, city)
VALUES (101,‚ÄòRaju‚Äô,‚ÄòDelhi‚Äô),
(102,‚Äòkaju‚Äô,‚Äòpelhi‚Äô);

we can update like this also
INSERT INTO person
VALUES (103,‚Äòalex‚Äô,‚Äòpune‚Äô);

READING DATA
Reading data f rom a Table

select * from person;
select name from person;

to read multiple coloums
select name, city from person;

UPDATING DATA
Modify/Update data f rom a Table
UPDATE person
SET city=‚ÄôLondon‚Äô
WHERE id=2;

DELETING DATA
DELETE data f rom a Table
DELETE FROM person
WHERE id=101

Draw Back of current structure
INSERT INTO person(id, name, city)
VALUES (100,‚ÄòRaju‚Äô,‚ÄòDelhi‚Äô),
(102,‚Äòkaju‚Äô,‚Äò‚Äô);

__________________________________________

Constraints are like a rule, by defining that, that allows us to validate the input data before storing that in the database. Constraints can be defined when the table is created with the CREATE TABLE statement, or after the table is created with the ALTER TABLE statement.

What are the 7 constraints in SQL?
Primary Key, Foreign Key, NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK, DEFAULT, INDEX

In PostgreSQL (and SQL in general), a clause is a part of an SQL statement that defines specific behavior or conditions. Clauses are like building blocks of SQL queries.

‚úÖ Common Clauses in PostgreSQL:
Clause	Description
SELECT	Retrieves data from a table
FROM	Specifies the table(s) to query
WHERE	Filters rows based on conditions
GROUP BY	Groups rows that share a value (used with aggregate functions)
HAVING	Filters groups after GROUP BY (like WHERE but for groups)
ORDER BY	Sorts the result by one or more columns
LIMIT	Limits the number of rows returned
OFFSET	Skips a number of rows before returning data
JOIN	Combines rows from multiple tables
ON	Specifies join condition
AS	Renames a column or table in a query (alias)
DISTINCT	Removes duplicate rows in SELECT output
INSERT INTO	Adds new rows to a table
VALUES	Specifies the data to insert
UPDATE	Modifies existing data in a table
SET	Specifies which columns to change in UPDATE
DELETE FROM	Removes rows from a table
RETURNING	Returns values after INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE
INTO	Specifies a new table for SELECT INTO queries
EXISTS	Tests for the existence of rows

üîç Example Query with Clauses:
sql
SELECT name, city         -- SELECT clause
FROM person               -- FROM clause
WHERE city = 'Nagpur'     -- WHERE clause
ORDER BY name ASC         -- ORDER BY clause
LIMIT 5;                  -- LIMIT clause
üß† Tip:
Every SQL statement is made of clauses. Understanding clauses helps you write and read queries more clearly.

Let me know if you want examples of specific clauses or how to use them in real queries.
