## üîπ **Day 9 ‚Äì String Functions**

---

### üé• Topics:

**üïê 01:49:59 ‚Äì CONCAT, REPLACE, SUBSTR, UPPER/LOWER, etc.**

---

## ‚úÖ 1. **CONCAT()** ‚Äì Combine Strings

```sql
SELECT CONCAT('Hello ', 'World');
-- Result: Hello World
```

üìå Combine first and last name (or name + email):

```sql
SELECT CONCAT(name, ' - ', email) AS full_info FROM student;
```

You can also use `||` as the concatenation operator:

```sql
SELECT name || ' <' || email || '>' AS contact FROM employee;
```

---

## ‚úÖ 2. **REPLACE()** ‚Äì Replace Substring

```sql
SELECT REPLACE('postgresql is cool', 'cool', 'awesome');
-- Result: postgresql is awesome
```

üìå Replace domain in email:

```sql
SELECT name, REPLACE(email, '@example.com', '@company.com') AS updated_email
FROM employee;
```

---

## ‚úÖ 3. **SUBSTRING() or SUBSTR()** ‚Äì Extract Part of a String

```sql
SELECT SUBSTRING('employee123' FROM 1 FOR 8);
-- Result: employee
```

```sql
-- Get first 3 letters of student names
SELECT SUBSTRING(name FROM 1 FOR 3) FROM student;
```

---

## ‚úÖ 4. **UPPER() / LOWER()** ‚Äì Convert Case

```sql
SELECT UPPER(name) FROM student;
SELECT LOWER(email) FROM employee;
```

---

## ‚úÖ 5. **TRIM() / LTRIM() / RTRIM()** ‚Äì Remove Spaces

```sql
SELECT TRIM('   name   ');
-- Result: 'name'
```

---

## ‚úÖ 6. **LENGTH()** ‚Äì Length of String

```sql
SELECT LENGTH(name) FROM student;
```

---

## ‚úÖ 7. **INITCAP()** ‚Äì Capitalize First Letter of Each Word

```sql
SELECT INITCAP('sneha roy') AS proper_name;
```

---

## üíª Practice Examples (Use on `student` / `employee`)

---

### ‚úÖ 1. Show name in uppercase

```sql
SELECT UPPER(name) FROM student;
```

---

### ‚úÖ 2. Get domain part of each employee's email

```sql
SELECT SUBSTRING(email FROM POSITION('@' IN email) + 1) AS domain
FROM employee;
```

---

### ‚úÖ 3. Replace `.com` with `.org` in email

```sql
SELECT REPLACE(email, '.com', '.org') FROM student;
```

---

### ‚úÖ 4. Show name + email in one column

```sql
SELECT name || ' <' || email || '>' AS contact_info FROM employee;
```

---

### ‚úÖ 5. Find employees with names longer than 5 characters

```sql
SELECT * FROM employee WHERE LENGTH(name) > 5;
```

---

### ‚úÖ 6. Capitalize student names properly

```sql
SELECT INITCAP(name) FROM student;
```

---

## üìò Practice Questions (PostgreSQL Only)

---

### Q1. Convert all student emails to lowercase.

```sql

```

---

### Q2. Show first 4 letters of each employee name.

‚úÖ Combine them with `SELECT`, `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, etc. for powerful queries.
