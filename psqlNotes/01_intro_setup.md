Here's a detailed **Day 1 – Intro & Setup** breakdown with **explanations, notes, and PSQL practice questions** based on your video outline:

## 🔹 **Day 1 – Intro & Setup**

### 🎥 Topics:

---

### ✅ 00:00 – **Intro to PostgreSQL**

**What is PostgreSQL?**

* PostgreSQL (or Postgres) is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system.
* Known for robustness, SQL compliance, and support for complex data types (JSON, arrays, spatial, etc.).
* Extensible: supports user-defined types, functions, custom operators.
* Popular for GIS (via PostGIS), web apps, analytics.

---

### ✅ 02:25 – **What is a Database?**

**Definition:**

* A *database* is a structured collection of data stored electronically.
* Enables easy access, manipulation, and retrieval of data.

**Real-World Analogy:**

* Like a digital filing cabinet that stores files (tables, data).

**Example in PostgreSQL:**

```sql
-- Creating a new database
CREATE DATABASE student_db;
```

### ✅ 04:00 – **DBMS vs RDBMS**

| Feature       | DBMS                | RDBMS                             |
| ------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Data Format   | Files, hierarchical | Tables (rows and columns)         |
| Relations     | No relations        | Supports relations (foreign keys) |
| Examples      | MS Access, XML      | PostgreSQL, MySQL, MSSQL          |
| Normalization | Not enforced        | Enforced to reduce redundancy     |
| Transactions  | Limited or none     | Fully supported                   |

---

### ✅ 06:32 – **What is RDBMS?**

**Definition:**

* RDBMS = Relational Database Management System.
* Manages data in *relational* (tabular) form.
* Each table has a unique *primary key* and can reference others via *foreign keys*.

**Key Features:**

* Data stored in tables (relations)
* SQL for querying
* ACID compliant (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)

---

### ✅ 08:36 – **Installation on Windows / Mac / Linux**

**Practice Steps:**

1. **Download** from: [https://www.postgresql.org/download/](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
2. **Install** with default options.
3. **Remember** the password for user `postgres`.
4. **Install pgAdmin** during setup (GUI tool for PostgreSQL).
5. **Open pgAdmin** > connect to default server > use password.

## 💻 **Practice Tasks (PSQL)**

---

### 1️⃣ **Create a New Database**

```sql
-- In pgAdmin or psql terminal
CREATE DATABASE practice_day1;
```

🔸 *Use `\l` to list all databases in psql.*

---

### 2️⃣ **Connect to a Database (in terminal)**

```bash
psql -U postgres -d practice_day1
```

---

### 3️⃣ **Create a Sample Table**

```sql
CREATE TABLE student (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    age INT
);
```

---

### 4️⃣ **Insert Sample Data**

```sql
INSERT INTO student (name, age)
VALUES 
('Alice', 22),
('Bob', 25);
```

---

### 5️⃣ **View the Table**

```sql
SELECT * FROM student;
```

---

### 📘 **Day 1 Practice Questions (PSQL Focused)**

---

#### Q1: What is the difference between PostgreSQL and MySQL?

> PostgreSQL is fully open-source, supports advanced data types and full ACID compliance. MySQL is often used for web apps but has limited compliance with advanced SQL features compared to PostgreSQL.

---

#### Q2: How do you list all databases in PostgreSQL?

```sql
\l
```

---

#### Q3: How do you connect to a specific database from psql terminal?

```bash
psql -U postgres -d database_name
```

---

#### Q4: Write a SQL query to create a database called `company_db`.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE company_db;
```

---

#### Q5: What command is used to view all tables in the current database?

```sql
\dt
```
