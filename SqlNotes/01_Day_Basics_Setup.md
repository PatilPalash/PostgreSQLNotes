### 6. **Create Sample Database**

‚úÖ Open MySQL Workbench > Login > Write this SQL:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE sample_db;
USE sample_db;

CREATE TABLE students (

    name VARCHAR(50),
    city VARCHAR(50)
);

INSERT INTO students VALUES (1, 'Ravi', 'Pune'), (2, 'Sneha', 'Mumbai');
```

üßæ Now run:

```sql
SELECT * FROM students;
```
