## üß† Concepts Explained

---

### 1. **What is a Database (DB)?**

* A **database** is an organized collection of data that is stored and accessed electronically.
* Examples: Contact list, Library records, Online shopping data.

#### ‚úÖ Features:

* Stores **structured data**
* Enables **easy retrieval and modification**
* Can be small (like a file) or massive (like Facebook's DB)

---

### 2. **What is DBMS?**

* **DBMS** is a software tool used to **create**, **manage**, and **manipulate** databases.

#### ‚úÖ Functions:

* Data insertion, deletion, updating
* User access control
* Backup and recovery

#### ‚úÖ Examples:

* MySQL, Oracle DB, Microsoft SQL Server, SQLite

---

### 3. **What is RDBMS?**

* **Relational DBMS** is a type of DBMS that stores data in **tables** (rows and columns).
* Each table can have **relationships** (foreign keys) with other tables.

#### ‚úÖ Features:

* Based on **E.F. Codd's Relational Model**
* Supports **ACID properties** (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability)
* Enforces **data integrity**

#### ‚úÖ Examples:

* MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MS SQL Server

### 4. **SQL vs MySQL**

| SQL                                       | MySQL                           |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Structured Query Language                 | RDBMS tool based on SQL         |
| A language for interacting with databases | A software that implements SQL  |
| Created by IBM                            | Developed by Oracle Corporation |
| Used in various DBMSs                     | One specific RDBMS              |

---

### 5. **MySQL Installation Overview**

* Install **MySQL Server** and **MySQL Workbench**
* Setup user/password (default: root)
* MySQL Workbench is a GUI for writing SQL commands

üîó [Installation Guide](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/) (if needed)

---

### 6. **Create Sample Database**

‚úÖ Open MySQL Workbench > Login > Write this SQL:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE sample_db;
USE sample_db;

CREATE TABLE students (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    city VARCHAR(50)
);

INSERT INTO students VALUES (1, 'Ravi', 'Pune'), (2, 'Sneha', 'Mumbai');
```

üßæ Now run:

```sql
SELECT * FROM students;
```

## ‚úÖ Practice Questions

### üéØ Conceptual (Theory)

1. What is the difference between DBMS and RDBMS?
2. List 3 advantages of using a database over storing data in Excel.
3. Explain how tables are related in RDBMS.

---

### üîç SQL Practice

1. Create a database called `school_db`.
2. Inside `school_db`, create a table called `teachers`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE teachers (
    id INT,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    subject VARCHAR(50)
);
```

3. Insert 2 records.
4. Select all records using:

```sql
SELECT * FROM teachers;
```

## üßë‚Äçüíª Suggested Tools for Practice:

* **MySQL Workbench** (GUI)
* **DBeaver** (alternative)
* **DB Fiddle** (online playground): [https://www.db-fiddle.com/](https://www.db-fiddle.com/)

Here are clear and concise answers for your questions:

---

### **1. What is the difference between DBMS and RDBMS?**

| Feature           | DBMS (Database Management System)               | RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)           |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Storage**  | Stores data as files or in navigational formats | Stores data in **tables (rows and columns)**            |
| **Relationships** | No support for relationships between data       | Supports **relationships using foreign keys and joins** |
| **Normalization** | Doesn't enforce normalization                   | Supports and enforces **data normalization**            |
| **Examples**      | Microsoft Access, File System                   | MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, Oracle                   |
| **Concurrency**   | Limited support for multiple users              | Designed to handle **multiple users simultaneously**    |

---

### **2. List 3 advantages of using a database over storing data in Excel**

1. **Data Integrity and Validation:**
   Databases enforce **data types, constraints, and rules**, ensuring more accurate and consistent data.

2. **Concurrency and Multi-user Support:**
   Databases allow **multiple users to access and update data simultaneously** without conflicts.

3. **Scalability and Querying Power:**
   Databases handle **large datasets efficiently** and support complex **queries (SQL)** for powerful data retrieval and reporting.

---

### **3. Explain how tables are related in RDBMS**

In an **RDBMS**, tables are related using **keys**:

* A **Primary Key** uniquely identifies each record in a table.
* A **Foreign Key** is a field in one table that refers to the **Primary Key** in another table.

This relationship allows:

* **Referential integrity** (data consistency across tables)
* Performing **JOIN operations** to retrieve related data from multiple tables.

**Example:**

* `Customers` table ‚Üí `CustomerID` (Primary Key)
* `Orders` table ‚Üí `CustomerID` (Foreign Key referencing Customers)

This shows which customer placed each order.
